#### Tutorial Overview

This includes the solution files for the programming assignments of each of the 5 courses in Deep Learning Series.

1. The `first` course is "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". This course is 4-weeks long.

2. The `second` one is "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization". It's 3-weeks long.

3. `Third` one is "Structuring Machine Learning Projects". It doesn't contain any programming assignments and it's the shortest among all with 2-weeks only.

4. `Fourth` is "Convolutional Neural Networks". It's four weeks long and hence a considerable amount of programming assignments are there.

5. And the final and `fifth` one is "Sequence Models". 3-weeks long and consists of some nice programming assignments.
