Mathematician by heart, Statistician by training, and Data Scientist by profession with extensive in-depth programming skills. I love developing data products and like to solve various real-world problems using machine learning, data mining, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools, such as Python and OpenCV TensorFlow, and Keras. Besides, I'm proficient in R, Matlab, and web designing tools like HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I've just started my career about 3 years ago in data analytics, data mining, and predictive modeling. I've done my summer project 2019 in IIT Mandi, where I learned GAN (Generative Adversarial Neural Nets) and used it to produce duplicate medical data. This model addresses the scarcity of data and saves us a lot of time and effort.

I've done both my undergrad and masters in IISER Kolkata, in Mathematics and Statistics. My final year MS project is about Multi-label image classification of Satellite Images of the Amazon Rainforest. Now I'll be pursuing another Master (in CSE) at IIITH to strengthen my required skills. My current research interests are mainly in Computer Vision domain like 2D and 3D object detection, image segmentation, video tracking, autonomous driving, and sports analytics.

Apart from my academic pursuit, I am involved passionately in various sports like badminton, 5K run, and cycling. I cherish badminton and cycling the most. Besides, I am very enthusiastic about painting, rapping, and cooking.

And thus different applications of data science is what I am very ardent about. And I believe in near future, I would have master a significant part of my interest. Till then  “Adios Amigos”.
